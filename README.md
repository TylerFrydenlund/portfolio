## About this Portfolio Repo

This repo demonstrates my cababilities as a backend web engineer. This "website" is an application called ["Shark Business" or "Shark Biz"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSuCu6vquno). Where the user can manage employees via a REST API. The microservice will handle the REST API request and interface with a Mongo Database to store employee data. See the [wiki](https://github.com/TylerFrydenlund/portfolio/wiki) for documentation.
