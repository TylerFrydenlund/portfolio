## About this Portfolio Repo

This repo demonstrates my cababilities as a front and backend web engineer. This "website" is an application called ["Shark Business" or "Shark Biz"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSuCu6vquno). Where the user can add employee's via a webpage. The webpage made in HTML 5, Javascript, and CSS will then interact with the back end Microservice. The microservice will handle the REST API request and add a new employee to the system.
