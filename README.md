# Portfolio
My name is Tyler Frydenlund. Im 19 from Thornton, Colorado and I have been developing softwear since 2015. This is my resume. This repository demonstrates some (but not all) of the technologies, practices, and concepts I am familiar with as a software engineer. This repo contains a demo project which demonstrates the work I do.

## Development practices I practice
- [Continuous Integration](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/#:~:text=Continuous%20integration%20is%20a%20DevOps,builds%20and%20tests%20are%20run.)
- [Continuous Delivery](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/)
- [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

## Familar technologies & Languages
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) (5+ years)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/why-spring) (For building backend webserverices in Java)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) (For building projects in Java)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org) (For building projects in many languages)

## About this Portfolio Repo

This repo demonstrates my cababilities as a backend web engineer. This is an application called [Shark Business or "Shark Biz"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSuCu6vquno) (named after a scene from the show "The Office"). Shark Biz allows the user to manage employees via a REST API built on the HTTPS Protocol. The microservice will handle the API request and interface with a Mongo Database to manage employee data. See the [wiki](https://github.com/TylerFrydenlund/portfolio/wiki) for documentation.
